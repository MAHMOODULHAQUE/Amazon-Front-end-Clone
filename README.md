This Amazon Clone is an interactive and responsive web application designed to replicate the user experience of the popular e-commerce platform. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it features a dynamic product catalog, search functionality, and a sleek, user-friendly interface.

The design is fully responsive, ensuring seamless browsing across devices, while interactive elements like hover effects and smooth transitions enhance the user experience. This project demonstrates my ability to implement core front-end technologies to create functional and visually appealing web pages.
